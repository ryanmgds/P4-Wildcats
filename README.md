# Covid DataBase
This is our trimester 2 project for AP CS Principles. We aspire to create an easy platform for users to get information on COVID-19.

## How to run our Covid Database
RPI / AWS in progress at the moment.

As of now, you can clone project onto your own machine, and run it from intellij.

# Easter Egg
Our easter egg is accesible through the navigation bar as a hidden button, but can change with future updates. 

# Goals
- Our biggest goal, that needs to be completed ASAP is the RPI / AWS deployment

- Create login session that can interact with a SQL database

- Pull from different websites (data curation), get more accurate data and new statistics that users will find useful

- Allow users to access other reviews, and be able to rate off stars, not just inputting a number.



# Big Ticket Items
This information can also be found on our scrum board: https://github.com/ryanmgds/P4-Wildcats/projects/1 

## Survey Table (CRUD)
Ryan worked on this. You can find it in the navbar, and you can fill out a survey report, rating your experience on our website. You also have the option to leave your contact information. Contains data filtering, however this portion is still needs some work.
